drydock_client - client for drydock_provisioner RESTful API
===========================================================

The drydock_client module can be used to access a remote (or local)
Drydock REST API server. It supports tokenized authentication and
marking API calls with an external context marker for log aggregation.

It is composed of two parts - a DrydockSession which denotes the call
context for the API and a DrydockClient which gives access to actual
API calls.

Simple Usage
============

The usage pattern for drydock_client is to build a DrydockSession
with your credentials and the target host. Then use this session
to build a DrydockClient to make one or more API calls. The
DrydockSession will care for TCP connection pooling and header
management:

.. code:: python

    import drydock_provisioner.drydock_client.client as client
    import drydock_provisioner.drydock_client.session as session

    dd_session = session.DrydockSession('host.com', port=9000, token='abc123')
    dd_client = client.DrydockClient(dd_session)

    drydock_task = dd_client.get_task('ba44e582-6b26-11e7-81cc-080027ef795a')

Drydock Client Method API
=========================

drydock_client.client.DrydockClient supports the following methods for
accessing the Drydock RESTful API

get_design_ids
--------------

Return a list of UUID-formatted design IDs

get_design
----------

Provide a UUID-formatted design ID, receive back a dictionary representing
an objects.site.SiteDesign instance. You can provide the kwarg 'source' with
the value of 'compiled' to see the site design after inheritance is applied.

create_design
-------------

Create a new design. Optionally provide a new base design (by UUID-formatted
design_id) that the new design uses as the starting state. Receive back a
UUID-formatted string of design_id

get_part
--------

Get the attributes of a particular design part. Provide the design_id the part
is loaded in, the kind (one of ``Region``, ``NetworkLink``, ``Network``,
``HardwareProfile``, ``HostProfile`` or ``BaremetalNode`` and the part key
(i.e. name). You can provide the kwarg 'source' with the value of 'compiled' to
see the site design after inheritance is applied.

load_parts
----------

Parse a provided YAML string and load the parts into the provided design context

get_tasks
---------

Get a list of all task ids

get_task
--------

Get the attributes of the task identified by the provided task_id

create_task
-----------

Create a task to execute the provided action on the provided design context
