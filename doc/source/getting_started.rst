Installing Drydock in a Dev Environment
=======================================

Bootstrap Kubernetes
--------------------

You can bootstrap your Helm-enabled Kubernetes cluster via the Openstack-Helm
`AIO <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/install/developer/index.html>`_
or the `Promenade <https://airship-promenade.readthedocs.io/>`_ tools.

Deploy Drydock and Dependencies
-------------------------------

Drydock is most easily deployed using Armada to deploy the Drydock
container into a Kubernetes cluster via Helm charts. The Drydock chart
is in the ``charts/drydock`` directory. It depends on
the deployments of the `MaaS <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/airship-maas/>`_
chart and the `Keystone <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-helm/>`_ chart.

A integrated deployment of these charts can be accomplished using the
`Armada <https://airship-armada.readthedocs.io/>`_ tool. An example integration
chart can be found in the
`Airship in a Bottle <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/airship-in-a-bottle/>`_ repo in the
``./manifests/dev_single_node`` directory.

Load Site
---------

To use Drydock for site configuration, you must craft and load a site topology
YAML. An example of this is in ``./test/yaml_samples/deckhand_fullsite.yaml``.

Documentation on building your topology document is at :ref:`topology_label`.

Drydock requires that the YAML topology be hosted somewhere, either the preferred
method of using `Deckhand <https://airship-deckhand.readthedocs.io/>`_
or through a simple HTTP server like Nginx or Apache.

Use the CLI to create tasks to deploy your site

.. code:: bash

    # drydock task create -d <design_url> -a verify_site
    # drydock task create -d <design_url> -a prepare_site
    # drydock task create -d <design_url> -a prepare_nodes
    # drydock task create -d <design_url> -a deploy_nodes

A demo of this process is available at https://asciinema.org/a/133906
