=======================
Authoring Site Topology
=======================

Drydock uses a YAML-formatted site topology definition to configure
downstream drivers to provision baremetal nodes. This topology describes
the networking configuration of a site as well as the set of node configurations
that will be deployed. A node configuration consists of network attachment,
network addressing, local storage, kernel selection and configuration and
metadata.

The best source for a sample of the YAML schema for a topology is the unit
test input `source </tests/yaml_samples/fullsite.yaml>`_ in
``./tests/yaml_samples/fullsite.yaml``.

Defining Networking
===================

Network definitions in the topology are described by two document types:
NetworkLink and Network. NetworkLink describes a physical or logical link
between a node and switch. It is concerned with attributes that must be agreed
upon by both endpoints: bonding, media speed, trunking, etc. A Network describes
the layer 2 and layer 3 networks accessible over a link.

Network Links
-------------

The NetworkLink document defines layer 1 and layer 2 attributes that should be
in-sync between the node and the switch. Each link can support a single untagged
VLAN and 0 or more tagged VLANs.

Example YAML schema of the NetworkLink spec:

.. code:: yaml

    spec:
      bonding:
        mode: 802.3ad
        hash: layer3+4
        peer_rate: slow
      mtu: 9000
      linkspeed: auto
      trunking:
        mode: 802.1q
      allowed_networks:
        - public
        - mgmt

``bonding`` describes combining multiple physical links into a single logical
link (aka LAG or link aggregation group).

* ``mode``: What bonding mode to configure

    * ``disabled``: Do not configure a bond
    * ``802.3ad``: Use 802.3ad dynamic aggregation (aka LACP)
    * ``active-backup``: Use static active/standby bonding
    * ``balanced-rr``: Use static round-robin bonding

For a ``mode`` of ``802.3ad`` the optional attributes below are available:

* ``hash``: The link selection hash. Supported values are ``layer3+4``,
  ``layer2+3``, ``layer2``. Default is ``layer3+4``
* ``peer_rate``: How frequently to send LACP control frames. Supported values
  are ``fast`` and ``slow``. Default is ``fast``
* ``mon_rate``: Interval between checking link state in milliseconds.
  Default is ``100``
* ``up_delay``: Delay in milliseconds between a link coming up and being marked
  up in the bond. Must be greater than ``mon_rate``. Default is ``200``
* ``down_delay``: Delay in milliseconds between a link going down and being
  marked down in the bond.  Must be greater than ``mon_rate``.
  Default is ``200``

``mtu`` is the maximum transmission unit for the link. It must be equal or
greater than the MTU of any VLAN interfaces using the link. Default is ``1500``.

``linkspeed`` is the physical layer speed and duplex. Recommended to always be
``auto``

``trunking`` describes how multiple layer 2 networks will be multiplexed on the
link.

    * ``mode``: Can be ``disabled`` for no trunking or ``802.1q`` for standard
      VLAN tagging
    * ``default_network``: For ``mode: disabled``, this is the single network on
      the link. For ``mode: 802.1q`` this is optionally the network accessed by
      untagged frames.

``allowed_networks`` is a sequence of network names listing all networks allowed
on this link. Each Network can be listed on one and only one NetworkLink.

Network
-------

The Network document defines the layer 2 and layer 3 networks nodes will access.
Each Network is accessible over exactly one NetworkLink. However that
NetworkLink can be attached to different interfaces on different nodes to
support changing hardware configurations.

Example YAML schema of the Network spec:

.. code:: yaml

    spec:
      vlan: '102'
      mtu: 1500
      cidr: 172.16.3.0/24
      routedomain: storage
      ranges:
        - type: static
          start: 172.16.3.15
          end: 172.16.3.200
        - type: dhcp
          start: 172.16.3.201
          end: 172.16.3.254
      routes:
        - subnet: 0.0.0.0/0
          gateway: 172.16.3.1
          metric: 10
        - gateawy: 172.16.3.2
          metric: 10
          routedomain: storage
      dns:
        domain: sitename.example.com
        servers: 8.8.8.8

If a Network is accessible over a NetworkLink using 802.1q VLAN tagging, the
``vlan`` attribute specified the VLAN tag for this Network. It should be omitted
for non-tagged Networks.

``mtu`` is the maximum transmission unit for this Network. Must be equal or less
than the ``mtu`` defined for the hosting NetworkLink. Can be omitted to default
to the NetworkLink ``mtu``.

``cidr`` is the classless inter-domain routing address for the network.

``routedomain`` is a logical grouping of L3 networks such that a network that
describes a static route for accessing the route domain will yield a list of
static routes for all the networks in the routedomain. See the description
of ``routes`` below for more information.

``ranges`` defines a sequence of IP addresses within the defined ``cidr``.
Ranges cannot overlap.

* ``type``: The type of address range.

    * ``static``: A range used for static, explicit address assignments for
      nodes.
    * ``dhcp``: A range used for assigning DHCP addresses. Note that a network
      being used for PXE booting must have a DHCP range defined.
    * ``reserved``: A range of addresses that will not be used by MaaS.

* ``start``: The starting IP of the range, inclusive.
* ``end``: The last IP of the range, inclusive

``routes`` defines a list of static routes to be configured on nodes attached to
this network. The routes can defined in one of two ways: an explicit destination
``subnet`` where the route will be configured exactly as described or a destination
``routedomain`` where Drydock will calculate all the destination L3 subnets for the
routedomain and add routes for each of them using the ``gateway`` and ``metric``
defined.

* ``subnet``: Destination CIDR for the route
* ``gateway``: The gateway IP on this Network to use for accessing the destination
* ``metric``: The metric or weight for this route
* ``routedomain``: Use this route's gateway and metric for accessing networks in the
  defined routedomain.

``dns`` is used for specifying the list of DNS servers to use if this network
is the primary network for the node.

* ``servers``: A comma-separated list of IP addresses to use for DNS resolution
* ``domain``: A domain that can be used for automated registration of IP
  addresses assigned from this Network

DHCP Relay
^^^^^^^^^^

DHCP relaying is used when a DHCP server is not attached to the same layer 2
broadcast domain as nodes that are being PXE booted. The DHCP requests from the
node are consumed by the relay (generally configured on a top-of-rack switch)
which then encapsulates the request in layer 3 routing and sends it to an
upstream DHCP server. The Network spec supports a ``dhcp_relay`` key for
Networks that should relay DHCP requests.

* The Network must have a configured DHCP relay, this is *not* configured by
  Drydock or MaaS.
* The ``upstream_target`` IP address must be a host IP address for a MaaS rack
  controller
* The Network must have a defined DHCP address range.
* The upstream target network must have a defined DHCP address range.

The ``dhcp_relay`` stanza:

.. code:: yaml

    dhcp_relay:
      upstream_target: 172.16.4.100

Defining Node Configuration
===========================

Node configuration is defined in three documents: ``HostProfile``,
``HardwareProfile`` and ``BaremetalNode``. ``HardwareProfile`` defines
attributes directly related to hardware configuration such as card-slot layout
and firmware levels. ``HostProfile`` is a generic definition for how a node
should be configured such that many nodes can reference a single ``HostProfile``
and each will be configured identically. A ``BaremetalNode`` is a concrete
reference to the particular physical node. The ``BaremetalNode`` definition will
reference a ``HostProfile`` and can then extend or override any of the
configuration values.

NOTE: Drydock does not support hostnames containing '__' (double underscore)

Hardware Profile
----------------

The hardware profile is used to convert some abstractions in the HostProfile documents
into concrete configurations based a particular hardware build. A host profile will
designate how the bootdisk should be configured, but the hardware profile will
designate which exact device is used for the bootdisk. This allows a heterogeneous mix
of hardware in a site without duplicating definitions of how that hardware should
be configured.

An example HardwareProfile document:

.. code:: yaml

    ---
    schema: 'drydock/HardwareProfile/v1'
    metadata:
      schema: 'metadata/Document/v1'
      name: AcmeServer
      storagePolicy: 'cleartext'
      labels:
        application: 'drydock'
    data:
      vendor: HP
      generation: '8'
      hw_version: '3'
      bios_version: '2.2.3'
      boot_mode: bios
      bootstrap_protocol: pxe
      pxe_interface: 0
      device_aliases:
        prim_nic01:
          address: '0000:00:03.0'
          dev_type: '82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller'
          bus_type: 'pci'
        prim_nic02:
          address: '0000:00:04.0'
          dev_type: '82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller'
          bus_type: 'pci'
        primary_boot:
          address: '2:0.0.0'
          dev_type: 'VBOX HARDDISK'
          bus_type: 'scsi'
      cpu_sets:
        sriov: '2,4'
      hugepages:
        sriov:
          size: '1G'
          count: 300
        dpdk:
          size: '2M'
          count: 530000

Device Aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Device aliases are a way of mapping a particular device bus address
to an alias. In the example above we map the PCI address ``0000:00:03.0``
to the alias ``prim_nic01``. A host profile or baremetal node definition
can then provide a configuration using ``prim_nic01`` and Drydock will
translate that to the correct operating system device name for the NIC device
at PCI address ``0000.00.03.0``. Currently device aliases are supported
for network interface slave devices and storage physical devices.

Kernel Parameter References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some kernel parameters specified in a host profile rely on particular hardware
builds, such as ``isolcpus``. To support the greatest flexibility in building
host profiles, you can specify a few values in a hardware profile that will then
be sourced when needed by a host profile or baremetal node definition.

* ``cpu_sets``: Each key should have a value of a comma-separated list of CPUs/cores/hyperthreads
  that would be appropriate for the ``isolcpus`` kernel parameters. A host profile can
  then select any one of these CPU sets for a host.
* ``hugepages``: Each key should have a value of a mapping containing two keys: ``size`` and
  ``count``. Again, a host profile can then select these values when defining kernel parameters
  for a host. Note the ``size`` field is a string and will be used as-is, so the format must
  be usable by the kernel.

Host Profiles and Baremetal Nodes
---------------------------------

Example ``HostProfile`` and ``BaremetalNode`` configuration:

.. code:: yaml

    ---
    apiVersion: 'drydock/v1'
    kind: HostProfile
    metadata:
      name: defaults
      region: sitename
      date: 17-FEB-2017
      author: sh8121@att.com
    spec:
      # configuration values
    ---
    apiVersion: 'drydock/v1'
    kind: HostProfile
    metadata:
      name: compute_node
      region: sitename
      date: 17-FEB-2017
      author: sh8121@att.com
    spec:
      host_profile: defaults
      # compute_node customizations to defaults
    ---
    apiVersion: 'drydock/v1'
    kind: BaremetalNode
    metadata:
      name: compute01
      region: sitename
      date: 17-FEB-2017
      author: sh8121@att.com
    spec:
      host_profile: compute_node
      # configuration customization specific to single node compute01


In the above example, the *compute_node* ``HostProfile`` adopts all values from
the *defaults* ``HostProfile`` and can then override defined values or append
additional values. ``BaremetalNode`` *compute01* then adopts all values from the
*compute_node* ``HostProfile`` (which includes all the configuration items it
adopted from *defaults*) and can then again override or append any
configuration that is specific to that node.

Defining Node Out-Of-Band Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drydock supports plugin-based OOB management. At a minimum a
OOB driver supports configuring a node to PXE boot during the next
boot cycle and power cycling the node to initiate the provisioning
process. Richer features might also be supported such as BIOS
configuration or BMC log analysis. The value of ``oob.type`` in the
host profile or baremetal node definition will define what additional
parameters are required for that type and what capabilities are available
via OOB driver tasks.

IPMI
""""

The ``ipmi`` OOB type requires additional configuration to allow OOB
management:

  1. The ``oob`` parameters ``account`` and ``credential`` must be populated with a valid
     account and password that can access the BMC via IPMI over LAN.
  2. The ``oob`` parameter ``network`` must reference which node network is used for OOB
     access.
  3. The ``addressing`` section of the node definition must contain an IP address assignment
     for the network referenced in ``oob.network``.

Currently the IPMI driver supports only basic management by setting nodes to PXE boot and
power-cycling the node.

Libvirt
"""""""

The ``libvirt`` OOB type requires additional configuration within the site definition
as well as particular configuration in the deployment of Drydock (and likely the node
provisioning driver.):

  1. A SSH public/private key-pair should be generated with the public key being added
     to the authorized_keys file on all hypervisors hosting libvirt-based VMs being
     deployed. The account for this must be in the ``libvirt`` group.
  2. The private key should be provided in the Drydock and MAAS charts as an override to
     ``conf.ssh.private_key``
  3. The Drydock and MAAS chart should override ``manifests.secret_ssh_key: true``.
  4. In the site definition, each libvirt-based node must define ``oob`` parameter
     ``libvirt_uri`` of the form ``qemu+ssh://account@hostname/system`` where ``account``
     is an account in the libvirt group on the hypervisor with an authorized_key and
     ``hostname`` is an IP address or FQDN for the hypervisor hosting the VM.

Currently the Libvirt driver supports only basic management by setting nodes to PXE boot and
power-cycling the node.

Defining Node Interfaces and Network Addressing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Node network attachment can be described in a ``HostProfile`` or a
``BaremetalNode`` document. Node addressing is allowed only in a
``BaremetalNode`` document. If a ``HostProfile`` or ``BaremetalNode`` needs to
remove a defined interface from an inherited configuration, it can set the
mapping value for the interface name to ``null``.

Once the interface attachments to networks is defined, ``HostProfile`` and
``BaremetalNode`` specs must define a ``primary_network`` attribute to denote
which network the node should use as the primary route.

Interfaces
""""""""""

Interfaces for a node can be described in either a ``HostProfile`` or
``BaremetalNode`` definition. This will attach a defined NetworkLink to a host
interface and define which Networks should be configured to use that interface.

Example interface definition YAML schema:

.. code:: yaml

    interfaces:
      pxe:
        device_link: pxe
        labels:
          pxe: true
        slaves:
          - prim_nic01
        networks:
          - pxe
      bond0:
        device_link: gp
        slaves:
          - prim_nic01
          - prim_nic02
        networks:
          - mgmt
          - private

Each key in the interfaces mapping is a defined interface. The key is the name
that will be used on the deployed node for the interface. The value must be a
mapping defining the interface configuration or ``null`` to denote removal of
that interface for an inherited configuration.

* ``device_link``: The name of the defined NetworkLink that will be attached to
  this interface. The NetworkLink definition includes part of the interface
  configuration such as bonding.
* ``labels``: Metadata for describing this interface.
* ``slaves``: The list of hardware interfaces used for creating this interface.
  This value can be a device alias defined in the HardwareProfile or the kernel
  name of the hardware interface. For bonded interfaces, this would list all the
  slaves. For non-bonded interfaces, this should list the single hardware
  interface used.
* ``networks``: This is the list of networks to enable on this interface. If
  multiple networks are listed, the NetworkLink attached to this interface must
  have trunking enabled or the design validation will fail.

Addressing
""""""""""

Addressing for a node can only be defined in a ``BaremetalNode`` definition. The
``addressing`` stanza simply defines a static IP address or ``dhcp`` for each
network a node should have a configured layer 3 interface on. It is a valid
design to omit networks from the ``addressing`` stanza, in that case the
interface attached to the omitted network will be configured as link up with no
address.

Example ``addressing`` YAML schema:

.. code:: yaml

  addressing:
    - network: pxe
      address: dhcp
    - network: mgmt
      address: 172.16.1.21
    - network: private
      address: 172.16.2.21
    - network: oob
      address: 172.16.100.21


Defining Node Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Storage can be defined in the ``storage`` stanza of either a HostProfile or
BaremetalNode document. The storage configuration can describe the creation of
partitions on physical disks, the assignment of physical disks and/or partitions
to volume groups, and the creation of logical volumes. Drydock will make a best
effort to parse out system-level storage such as the root filesystem or boot
filesystem and take appropriate steps to configure them in the active node
provisioning driver. At a minimum, the storage configuration *must* contain
a root filesystem partition.

Example YAML schema of the ``storage`` stanza:

.. code:: yaml

    storage:
      physical_devices:
        sda:
          labels:
            bootdrive: true
          partitions:
            - name: 'root'
              size: '10g'
              bootable: true
              filesystem:
                mountpoint: '/'
                fstype: 'ext4'
                mount_options: 'defaults'
            - name: 'boot'
              size: '1g'
              filesystem:
                mountpoint: '/boot'
                fstype: 'ext4'
                mount_options: 'defaults'
        sdb:
          volume_group: 'log_vg'
      volume_groups:
        log_vg:
          logical_volumes:
            - name: 'log_lv'
              size: '500m'
              filesystem:
                mountpoint: '/var/log'
                fstype: 'xfs'
                mount_options: 'defaults'

Schema
""""""

The ``storage`` stanza can contain two top-level keys: ``physical_devices`` and
``volume_groups``. The latter is optional.

Physical Devices and Partitions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A physical device can either be carved up in partitions (including a single
partition consuming the entire device) or added to a volume group as a physical
volume. Each key in the ``physical_devices`` mapping represents a device on a
node. The key should either be a device alias defined in the HardwareProfile or
the name of the device published by the OS. The value of each key must be a
mapping with the following keys

* ``labels``: A mapping of key/value strings providing generic labels for the
  device
* ``partitions``: A sequence of mappings listing the partitions to be created on
  the device. The mapping is described below. Incompatible with the
  ``volume_group`` specification.
* ``volume_group``: A volume group name to add the device to as a physical
  volume. Incompatible with the ``partitions`` specification.

Partition
"""""""""

A partition mapping describes a GPT partition on a physical disk. It can be left
as a raw block device or formatted and mounted as a filesystem.

* ``name``: Metadata describing the partition in the topology
* ``size``: The size of the partition. See the *Size Format* section below
* ``bootable``: Boolean whether this partition should be the bootable device
* ``part_uuid``: A UUID4 formatted UUID to assign to the partition. If not
  specified one will be generated
* ``filesystem``: An optional mapping describing how the partition should be
  formatted and mounted

    * ``mountpoint``: Where the filesystem should be mounted. If not specified
      the partition will be left as a raw device
    * ``fstype``: The format of the filesystem. Defaults to ext4
    * ``mount_options``: fstab style mount options. Default is 'defaults'
    * ``fs_uuid``: A UUID4 formatted UUID to assign to the filesystem. If not
      specified one will be generated
    * ``fs_label``: A filesystem label to assign to the filesystem. Optional.

Size Format
"""""""""""

The size specification for a partition or logical volume is formed from three
parts:

* The first character can optionally be ``>`` indicating that the size specified
  is a minimum and the calculated size should be at least the minimum and should
  take the rest of the available space on the physical device or volume group.
* The second part is the numeric portion and must be an integer
* The third part is a label

    * m|M|mb|MB: Megabytes or 10^6 * the numeric
    * g|G|gb|GB: Gigabytes or 10^9 * the numeric
    * t|T|tb|TB: Terabytes or 10^12 * the numeric
    * mi|Mi|mib|MiB: Mebibytes or 2^20 * the numeric
    * gi|Gi|gib|GiB: Gibibytes or 2^30 * the numeric
    * ti|Ti|tib|TiB: Tibibytes or 2^40 * the numeric
    * %: The percentage of total device or volume group space

Volume Groups and Logical Volumes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Logical volumes can be used to create RAID-0 volumes spanning multiple physical
disks or partitions. Each key in the ``volume_groups`` mapping is a name
assigned to a volume group. This name must be specified as the ``volume_group``
attribute on one or more physical devices or partitions or the configuration is
invalid. Each mapping value is another mapping describing the volume group.

* ``vg_uuid``: A UUID4 format uuid applied to the volume group. If not
  specified, one is generated
* ``logical_volumes``: A sequence of mappings listing the logical volumes to be
  created in the volume group

Logical Volume
""""""""""""""

A logical volume is a RAID-0 volume. Using logical volumes for ``/`` and
``/boot`` is supported

* ``name``: Required field. Used as the logical volume name.
* ``size``: The logical volume size. See *Size Format* above for details.
* ``lv_uuid``: A UUID4 format uuid applied to the logical volume: If not
  specified, one is generated
* ``filesystem``: A mapping specifying how the logical volume should be
  formatted and mounted. See the *Partition* section above for filesystem
  details.

Platform Configuration
----------------------

In the ``platform`` stanza you can define the operating system ``image``
and ``kernel`` to use as well as customize the kernel configuration with
``kernel_params``.

Image and Kernel Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The valid ``image`` and ``kernel`` values are dependent on what is supported
by your node provisioner. In the example of Canonical MaaS using the 16.04 LTS
image, the values would be ``image: 'xenial'`` and ``kernel: 'ga-16.04'`` for the
LTS kernel or ``kernel: hwe-16.04`` for the hardware-enablement kernel.

Kernel Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``kernel_params`` configuration is a mapping. Each key should either be a string
or boolean value. For boolean ``true`` values, the key will be added to the kernel
parameter list as a flag. For string values, the key:value pair will be added to the
kernel parameter list as ``key=value``.

Parameter References
""""""""""""""""""""

One special case is supported for values that match a hardware profile reference.
When the parameter is rendered for a particular node, the value included in the
kernel parameter list will be sourced from the effective HardwareProfile assigned
to the node.

* ``hardwareprofile:cpuset.<name>``: Sourced from the hardware profile ``cpu_sets.<name>``
  value.
* ``hardwareprofile.hugepages.<name>.size``: Source from the hardware profile
  ``hugepages.<name>.size`` value.
* ``hardwareprofile.hugepages.<name>.count``: Source from the hardware profile
  ``hugepages.<name>.count`` value.
